## MongoDB Models

### PropertyCard Model

```javascript
const PropertyCardSchema = new Schema({
    community: {
        type: String,
        enum: communityEnum,
        required: true,
    },
    building: {
        type: String,
        enum: buildingEnum,
        required: true,
    },
    unitNo: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
    leads: [
        {
            type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
            ref: "User",
        },
    ],
});
PropertyCardSchema.index(
    { community: 1, building: 1, unitNo: 1 },
    { unique: true }
);
```

### User Model

```javascript
const UserSchema = new Schema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true,
    },
    phoneNumber: {
        type: Number,
        required: true,
        unique: true,
    },
});
```

### Admin Model

```javascript
const AdminSchema = new Schema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },

        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true,
        lowercase: true,
    },
    password: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
});

AdminSchema.statics.findAndValidate = async function (email, password) {
    const foundUser = await this.findOne({ email });
    if (!foundUser) return false;
    const validPassword = await bcrypt.compare(password, foundUser.password);
    return validPassword ? foundUser : false;
};

AdminSchema.pre("save", async function (next) {
    if (!this.isModified("password")) next();
    this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 12);
